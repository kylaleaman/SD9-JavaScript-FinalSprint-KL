# SD-JavaScript-FinalSprint-KL
This is the JavaScript portion of my Final Sprint. There are three files included, an index HTML file, a JS file, and a JSON file. I have created a database for the good people of Stars Hollow to keep track of the people who frequent the town, their hobbies to know what types of activities to plan and whether they would be attending.
